# Sweep

Automated nightly code sweep that rotates through work repos. Picks the stalest area, runs the appropriate planning skill, creates GitHub issues, and logs everything for the morning briefing.

## How It Works

The sweep orchestrates three existing skills based on the audit type:

| Type from `rolling-audit.sh` | Skill to run | What it finds |
|------------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| `tech-debt` | `/tech-debt` | Dead code, god modules, deprecated patterns, missing abstractions |
| `security` | `/security-audit` | Credential leaks, injection vectors, auth gaps, TLS issues |
| `enhancement` | `/product-enhance` | UX gaps, missing features, performance issues, API inconsistencies |

Each skill is run with `--auto --github-issues` flags so it operates non-interactively and creates GitHub issues directly.

## Operations

### 1. Run (default)

Execute a full sweep cycle. This is what the 9pm cron triggers.

**Step 1: Pick target**
```bash
bash ~/assistant/rolling-audit.sh suggest
```
Outputs: REPO, DIR, TYPE, STALENESS (days), REPO_PATH. The script rotates through repos and directories, always picking the stalest area.

**Step 2: Pull latest code**
```bash
cd <REPO_PATH> && git checkout main && git pull
```
Always sweep against the latest main branch.

**Step 3: Launch the audit subagent**

Spawn a **background** Agent (subagent_type: general-purpose) with this prompt structure:

```
You are running an automated {TYPE} audit.

1. cd to {REPO_PATH}
2. Run the /{SKILL} skill with --auto --github-issues flags, targeting the {DIR} directory
3. Use: Skill tool with skill="{SKILL}" and args="--auto --github-issues {DIR}"

After the skill completes, collect:
- All GitHub issue URLs created
- Key findings summary with severity levels
- Positive notes (what's well-implemented)

Return a structured summary with:
- REPO: {REPO}
- DIR: {DIR}
- TYPE: {TYPE}
- ISSUES: comma-separated list of issue URLs
- FINDINGS: brief summary of key findings
```

**IMPORTANT: The subagent needs full permissions.** It will:
- Read many files across the repo (Glob, Grep, Read)
- Search code patterns (Grep)
- Create GitHub issues (mcp__github__create_issue)
- Run the Skill tool

If the subagent can't create issues due to permissions, the sweep fails silently. Ensure GitHub MCP tools are in the allow list.

**Step 4: Process results**

When the subagent completes, parse its output for REPO, DIR, TYPE, ISSUES, and FINDINGS.

Log the audit:
```bash
python3 ~/assistant/audit-tracker.py log --repo {REPO} --directory {DIR} --type {TYPE} --issues {ISSUE_URLS}
```

**Step 5: Write summary**

Overwrite `~/assistant/audit-results/latest.md` with:
```markdown
# Audit Results — {DATE} (Evening)

**Repo:** {REPO}
**Directory:** {DIR}
**Type:** {TYPE}
**Issues Created:** {COUNT}

## High Priority ({N})
- [#{NUM}](URL) — one-line description

## Medium Priority ({N})
- [#{NUM}](URL) — one-line description

## Key Findings
- bullet points

## Positive Notes
- what's well-implemented
```

**Step 6: No Telegram**

Do NOT send a Telegram message. The `/briefing morning` skill reads `latest.md` automatically and includes it in the morning briefing.

### 2. Status

Show sweep health without running anything:

```bash
python3 ~/assistant/audit-tracker.py stale
```
```bash
python3 ~/assistant/audit-tracker.py history
```
```bash
cat ~/assistant/audit-results/latest.md
```

Reports: last audit date/repo, stalest repos needing attention, full audit history, and the most recent findings.

## Failure Handling

- If `rolling-audit.sh suggest` returns no suggestion → all repos recently audited. Write "All repos current" to latest.md.
- If the subagent fails or times out → log the failure with `audit-tracker.py`, write an error summary to latest.md noting the repo and failure reason.
- If the suggested directory doesn't exist in the repo → the planning skill will scan the repo and find the right directories automatically. Don't fail on this.
- If GitHub issue creation fails (permissions) → still log findings to latest.md without issue links.

## Cron Integration

The 9pm weekday cron (`evening-audit.sh`) sends `/sweep` to the tmux session. The skill handles everything from there.

```
# In crontab:
0 21 * * 1-5 <BOT_DIR>/evening-audit.sh
```

## Instructions

1. Always use `rolling-audit.sh suggest` to pick the target — never choose manually
2. Always pull latest code before auditing
3. Always run via background subagent — don't block the main session
4. Always log with `audit-tracker.py` after completion, even on failure
5. Always overwrite `latest.md` with fresh results
6. The directory suggestion is a hint — if it doesn't exist, let the planning skill discover the right paths
