# Bot Archetypes

Proven bot configurations for common use cases. Each archetype lists the MCP servers, skills, and Telegram settings that work well together.

## Skill Layers

Skills come from two sources:

1. **Global skills** (`~/.claude/skills/`) — shared by all bots. General-purpose development, review, and workflow tools. Managed by [claudefather](https://github.com/Artemis-xyz/claudefather) (or your own global skill repo).

2. **Project skills** (`~/claudlobby/my-bot/.claude/skills/`) — specific to one bot. Only visible when Claude runs in that bot's directory.

This separation means engineer bots inherit `/review-pr` and `/worktree` from the global layer without needing their own copies, while a business bot's `/orders` skill stays invisible to everyone else.

### Global Skills (via claudefather)

These are available to every bot on the system:

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/review-pr` | Structured PR code review |
| `/commit-push-pr` | Stage, commit, push, and open PR in one step |

## Manager / Orchestrator Bot

The brain of the fleet. Converses freely, delegates to workers, monitors health.

### Project Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/dispatch` | Send tasks to fleet bots via tmux with structured tracking |
| `/lifecycle` | Full pipeline: implement → review → iterate → merge → retro → issues |
| `/fleet-status` | Health check across all bots (alive/dead, context %, idle/working) |

| `/data-alert-sweep` | Batch-process alerts: Slack → investigate → fix → PR → reply |

### Crons

```crontab
# Daily briefings
30 8 * * * /path/to/bot/briefing-cron.sh morning
0 13 * * * /path/to/bot/briefing-cron.sh midday
30 18 * * * /path/to/bot/briefing-cron.sh evening
```

## Engineer Bot

Focused executor. Takes tasks from the manager, works in worktrees, creates PRs.

**Telegram:** `requireMention: true` (only responds when @mentioned)
**Model:** Opus (needs strong coding ability)

### MCP Servers (lean)

| Server | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| GitHub | Repos, PRs, branches |
| Slack | Read-only context from alert/discussion channels (optional) |
| Notion | Update task status after completing work (optional) |

### Project Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/restart` | Graceful self-restart |
| `/eng-status` | Self-diagnostic (uptime, memory, session) |

**Inherits from global:** `/review-pr`, `/worktree`, `/commit-push-pr`, `/tech-debt`, `/security-audit`, `/implement-plan`

### CLAUDE.md Essentials

```markdown
## How You Work

- You don't initiate work — you execute what's assigned
- Work in git worktrees for isolation
- Always branch, always PR, never push to main
- When done, report back via report-back.sh
- If blocked, report back immediately. Don't spin.
```

### No Crons

Engineer bots are reactive — they only work when dispatched. No scheduled briefings or automated tasks.

---

## Code Reviewer Bot

Dedicated PR reviewer. Fast, thorough, runs on Sonnet to save cost.

**Telegram:** `requireMention: true`
**Model:** Sonnet (`CLAUDE_EXTRA_FLAGS="--model sonnet"` in bot.conf)

### MCP Servers (minimal)

| Server | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| GitHub | Read PRs, files, comments; post reviews |
| Notion | Update task status after review (optional) |

### Project Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/restart` | Graceful self-restart |
| `/review-status` | Self-diagnostic |

**Inherits from global:** `/review-pr` (the core skill)

### CLAUDE.md Essentials

```markdown
## How You Work

- You only do code reviews — nothing else
- When given a PR, use /review-pr
- Focus on correctness, clean design, test coverage, maintainability
- Be constructive, not pedantic — flag what matters
- Approve, request changes, or comment — always give a clear verdict
- Never merge PRs — only review them
```

### Why Sonnet?

Code review is read-heavy and pattern-matching — Sonnet handles it well at lower cost and faster speed. Reserve Opus for bots that need complex reasoning (orchestration, multi-step engineering).

---

## Designer / Visual QA Bot

Visual quality auditor. Crawls deployed apps, screenshots at multiple viewports, compares against design tokens, files issues.

**Telegram:** `requireMention: true`
**Model:** Opus (needs visual reasoning)

### MCP Servers

| Server | Purpose |

| GitHub | File issues, read repos for design tokens |
| Notion | Track design debt (optional) |

### Project Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/visual-crawl` | Autonomous crawl + screenshot + issue-filing |
| `/design-norms` | Load design system tokens before reviewing |
| `/restart` | Graceful self-restart |

**Inherits from global:** `/design-review`, `/frontend-performance-audit`

### CLAUDE.md Essentials

```markdown
## How You Work

- Crawl deployed apps at 3 viewports (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Compare against design system tokens and norms
- File GitHub issues for every finding with screenshots
- Focus on visual consistency, accessibility, responsive behavior
```

## Business / E-Commerce Bot

Customer-facing bot with personality. Handles orders, emails, fulfillment, task tracking.

### Persona

The business bot is the one place where personality matters. Write the CLAUDE.md persona section to match your brand voice. The bot should be in-character in customer emails, team chat, and internal work.
